# Paint-Like Application in Custom MIPS Assembly

## About

The **Paint-Like Application** is a graphical drawing tool developed entirely in custom MIPS assembly language. This project showcases low-level programming skills by handling user input, managing graphics operations, and optimizing memory usage without relying on high-level rendering libraries. Key features include:

- **Line Drawing:** Enables users to create straight lines by clicking and dragging the mouse.
- **Flood Fill:** Allows users to fill enclosed areas with selected colors efficiently.
- **Sprite Management:** Handles and manipulates graphical sprites to enhance visual interactions.
- **User Input Processing:** Supports intuitive controls for selecting colors, switching draw modes, and interacting seamlessly with the canvas.

This application serves as a testament to the power of assembly language in creating functional and responsive graphical tools from the ground up.
