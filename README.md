Paint-Like Application in Custom MIPS Assembly
About
The Paint-Like Application is a graphical drawing tool developed entirely in custom MIPS assembly language. This project showcases low-level programming skills by handling user input, managing graphics operations, and optimizing memory usage without relying on high-level rendering libraries. Key features include:

Line Drawing: Enables users to create straight lines by clicking and dragging the mouse.
Flood Fill: Allows users to fill enclosed areas with selected colors efficiently.
Sprite Management: Handles and manipulates graphical sprites to enhance visual interactions.
User Input Processing: Supports intuitive controls for selecting colors, switching draw modes, and interacting seamlessly with the canvas.
This application serves as a testament to the power of assembly language in creating functional and responsive graphical tools from the ground up.
